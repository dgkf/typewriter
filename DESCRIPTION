Description:
    Adds type annotations and runtime type checks for R in a convenient syntax.
    Provides an interface for type generics and type bounds, using standard R
    functions to provide a form of class traits or interfaces. Aims to work
    nicely with the existing R ecosystem, allowing the type system to work
    out-of-the-box without the need to declare types or define types manually.
